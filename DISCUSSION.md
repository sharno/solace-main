Some other ideas I had but didn't find enough time to implement:

- Add connection pooling
- Cache frequently accessed data in Redis
- Use cursor-based pagination
- Add React Query for data fetching
- Add autocomplete for search inputs
- Make responsive for mobile
- Add stricter TypeScript typing
- Validate API responses with zod
- Add comprehensive testing suite
- Add rate limiting to API
